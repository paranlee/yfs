<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
As the final lab in 6.824, you will complete a small coding project of
your choice related to the class material somehow, submit a short
writeup on what you did, and present a demo to the class staff (and
possibly the whole class).

<p>
You are free to choose any project you like, as long as it has
something to do with distributed systems, consists of original work
done for the class (<i>i.e.</i>, don't simply recycle a past research
project and try to put a 6.824 spin on it), and is of an appropriate
scope (see below).  We suggest that you take your now functional
fault-tolerant, distributed file system and extend it in some
interesting way.

<p>
We expect your
project to continue in the tradition of the labs: find some real
problem with an existing system (such as YFS), code up a solution
to the problem, and present what you did.  See the "Examples" section
for some possible projects.

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>
Your project should meet the following requirements:

<ul>

<li><p><b>Collaboration</b>: Please do your project in a team of two
or three people. You will
submit one writeup per team.  If your team chooses to do a YFS-based
project, you will have to choose one member's implementation as the
starting codebase.  Free free to use Piazza to
find a partner.

<p>
Please email <a href=
"mailto:6.824-staff@pdos.csail.mit.edu">6.824-staff</a> by <b>5:00 pm
on Tuesday, May 1</b> with the names of your team members and
a few sentences describing what you plan to do.

<li><p><b>Scope</b>: We expect the programming aspect of your project to
be similar in difficulty to one of the 6.824 2-week labs, such as Lab
4 or Lab 6, adjusted to reflect the number of students working on the
project.  Please email the staff with your project idea if you'd
like to know what we think about its suitability.  Note that while you
will not be required to hand in your code for the project, you will
have to meet with the TA and intelligently discuss what you did.

<p>Again, the project must have some relation to the class material.
Any YFS extension of suitable scope is fine, as is any other project
related directly to one of the papers or topics covered in class.  If
you have a project in mind that is only tangentially related, please
check with us first.
 
<li><p><b>Write-up</b>: A brief 1-page writeup on your project is due
by the lab deadline stated above.  This should explain what problem
you solved, how you solved it, and how successful you were in solving
it.  Please provide enough detail for us to get a sense of how much
effort went into your project, but don't write a complete, formal
research paper.  You may want to also include a measure of the number
of lines of code you wrote.

<li><p><b>TA Demos</b>: Each team will meet with the TA for five or ten
minutes to discuss their project and to demonstrate their code.
These meetings will take place on Monday, May 14th, or Wednesday, May
16th. We will send out an announcement about
scheduling these meetings when the deadline gets closer.

<li><p><b>In-Class Demos</b>:
The final lecture of the semester will be dedicated to
project demos. There may not be enough time to fit all
groups into 80 minutes; we will make a plan when we know how
many groups there are.

</ul>

<h3>Examples</h3>

Below are some example extensions to YFS that would make suitable
projects.  Feel free to use one of these if you have no idea of 
your own.

<ul>

<li><p><b>Complete fault-tolerance</b>: Extend YFS to be tolerant of
arbitrary client failures.  This will involve some plan of lock
expiration (<i>e.g.</i>, leases), persistent logging of client
operations, and crash recovery, all in the spirit of Frangipani.  You
may also need to come up with a more robust scheme for RPC sequence
numbers, as you don't want a restarted client to re-use the same
sequence numbers it was using before it crashed.  You should also
replicate your extent server using the Paxos-based replicated state
machine from Lab 6, making your YFS impervious to failures at all
levels.

<li><p><b>Distributed storage</b>: At the moment your YFS
implementation just uses a single extent server to store its data.  It
would be much more useful, for load-balancing purposes, if YFS could
spread its data across many extent servers.  You can implement the
<a href="ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/SRC/publications/eklee/petal-paper.pdf">
Petal</a> design, consistent hashing as
in <a href="../papers/stoica-chord.pdf">Chord</a>,
voting as in
<a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/ssp/papers/2004-10-ASPLOS-FAB.pdf">FAB</a>,
or use a scheme of your own.  Show some benefit of this system
under a real workload, either in terms of performance or fault
tolerance.

<li><p><b>Peer-to-peer data transfer</b>: Implement a protocol
in which nodes
do not have to write dirty extents back to the extent server, but can
instead transfer them directly to the next YFS server that wants to
access the extent.  You should also implement read/write locking,
allowing multiple peers to access the extent for reading at the same
time.  Demonstrate some scenarios where the new scheme outperforms the
old scheme.

<li><p><b>SUNDR</b>: Implement the strawman proposal
of <a href="../papers/li-sundr.pdf">SUNDR</a> (plus whatever other
optimizations you have time for) within the context of YFS, and
demonstrate that the system provides fork consistency.  You will need
to modify YFS to keep signed logs of extent accesses, and extend your
FUSE interface to have some notion of a user and the user's associated
keys.

<li><p><b>Bandwidth- and disk-space efficient extent service</b>:
Currently, your YFS implementation probably stores whole files as
extents in memory, and returns the entire file on each get.  The goal
in this project would be to reduce the network traffic between the
extent server and its clients, as well as reducing the memory and disk
usage of the extent server.  You should come up with an efficient
scheme for laying out extents on disk (for example, use a single file
on the native file system to store all of the extents, and do your
best to reduce fragmentation of the space within that file); take both
large and small files into consideration.  You may also want to use
compression to limit the size of the data on disk.  Furthermore, there
are known techniques for how to reduce bandwidth between the server
and clients by sending only diffs of data, rather than the full extent
(see
the <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/lbfs:sosp01/lbfs.pdf">LBFS</a>
paper, for example); you should implement some similar scheme for YFS.
You may also want to consider storing files in blocks, rather than one
huge extent, if you think that makes sense.  Demonstrate the
performance and space benefits of your modifications.

<li><p><b>Access control</b>: Implement a robust notion of access
control in YFS.  As in the SUNDR project, you'll have to extent your
FUSE interface to know about users (and groups!), and also make the
appropriate extensions to your YFS data structures.  You'll also need
to add support for any related file system calls
(<i>i.e.</i>, <tt>chmod</tt>, <tt>chown</tt>, <tt>chgrp</tt>, etc).
Once this is in place, you should consider encrypting the files on
disk for per-user or per-group data privacy.

<li><p><b>Disconnected operation</b>: Since your YFS server already
supports the caching of extents, you can imagine a version of YFS that
will allow the user to make modifications to cached data, and create
new files and directories, even if it cannot currently talk to the
lock server or the extent server.  To implement this, you'll probably
need to implement leases on locks, and come up with some plan for
merging divergent extents once the client comes back online.  Check
out
the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~satya/docdir/coda.pdf">Coda</a>
paper for inspiration on this topic.  A cool demo would be to mount
YFS on a laptop (where the extent and lock servers are running on a
server somewhere), cache some data locally, disconnect the laptop from
the network, and continue working on the files.  Then once the laptop
is back online, mount the directory from a different location and
ensure the changes made offline have propagated to the extent server.

</ul>
