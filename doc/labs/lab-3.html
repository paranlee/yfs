<h2>Introduction</h2>

In this lab, you will:

<ul>
  <li>Add handlers for the MKDIR and UNLINK FUSE operations,</li>
  <li>Add locking to ensure that concurrent operations
to the same file/directory from different <tt>yfs_client</tt>s
occur one at a time.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>
First, merge your solution to Lab 2 with the new code for Lab 3.
The only interesting difference are some new test scripts.
You can use the following commands to get the
Lab 3 sources; see the directions for <a href="lab-2.html">Lab 2</a>
for more background on git.

<pre>
% <b>cd lab</b>
% <b>git commit -am 'my solution to lab2'</b>

Created commit ...
% <b>git pull</b>
remote: Generating pack...
...
% <b>git checkout -b lab3 origin/lab3</b>
Branch lab4 set up to track remote branch refs/remotes/origin/lab4.
Switched to a new branch "lab3"
% <b>git merge lab2</b>
</pre>

As before, if git reports any conflicts, edit the files to merge them
manually, then run <tt><nobr>git commit -a</nobr></tt>.

Since you are building on the previous labs, <font color=red>ensure
the code in your Lab 3 directory passes all tests for Labs 1 and 2
before starting this lab</font>.

<h2>Part 1: MKDIR, UNLINK</h2>
<h3>Part 1: Your Job</h3>

<p>Your job in part 1 is to handle the MKDIR and UNLINK FUSE
operations.
Make sure that when you choose the <tt>inum</tt> for a new directory
created with MKDIR, that <tt>inum</tt> has its most significant bit
set to 0 (as explained in <a href="lab-2.html">Lab 2</a>).
For MKDIR, you do not have to create "." or ".." entries in the new directory
since the Linux kernel handles them transparently to YFS.
UNLINK should always free the file's extent; you do not need to
implement UNIX-style link counts.

<p>
When you're done with Part 1, the following should work:

<pre>
% <b>./start.sh</b>
% <b>mkdir yfs1/newdir</b>
% <b>echo hi &gt; yfs1/newdir/newfile</b>
% <b>ls yfs1/newdir/newfile</b>
yfs1/newdir/newfile
% <b>rm yfs1/newdir/newfile</b>
% <b>ls yfs1/newdir</b>
% <b>./stop.sh</b>
</pre>

<p>If your implementation passes the <tt>test-lab-3-a.pl</tt> script, you are 
done with part 1.  The test script creates a directory, creates and deletes lots of
files in the directory, and checks file and directory <tt>mtime</tt>s and <tt>ctime</tt>s.  
Note that this is the first test that explicitly checks the correctness of these
time attributes.  A create should change both the parent directory's <tt>mtime</tt> and
<tt>ctime</tt>. Here is a successful run of the tester:

<pre>
% <b>./start.sh</b>
% <b>./test-lab-3-a.pl ./yfs1</b>
mkdir ./yfs1/d3319
create x-0
delete x-0
create x-1
checkmtime x-1
...
delete x-33
dircheck
Passed all tests!
% <b>./stop.sh</b>
</pre>

<h2>Part 2: Locking </h2>

Next, you are going to ensure the
atomicity of file system operations when there are
multiple <tt>yfs_client</tt> processes sharing a file system.
Your current implementation does not handle
concurrent operations correctly.  For example, your <tt>yfs_client</tt>'s create method
probably reads the directory's contents from the extent server, makes some
changes, and stores the new contents back to the extent server.
Suppose
two clients issue simultaneous CREATEs for different file names in the same
directory via different <tt>yfs_client</tt> processes. Both <tt>yfs_client</tt> processes might
fetch the old directory contents at the same time and each might insert the newly created
file for its client and write back the new directory contents.  Only
one of the files would be present in the directory in the end.  The correct answer,
however, is for both files to exist.  This is
one of many potential races.  Others exist: concurrent 
CREATE and UNLINK, concurrent MKDIR and UNLINK, concurrent WRITEs, etc.

<p>You should eliminate YFS races by having <tt>yfs_client</tt>
use your lock server's locks.
For example, a <tt>yfs_client</tt> should acquire a lock on the
directory before starting a CREATE,
and only release the lock after finishing the write of the new information
back to the extent server. If there are concurrent operations, the locks
force one of the two operations to delay until the other one has completed.
All <tt>yfs_client</tt>s must acquire locks from the same lock
server. 

<h3>Part 2: Your Job</h3>

<p>
Your job is to add locking to <tt>yfs_client</tt> to ensure
the correctness of concurrent operations.
The testers for this part of the lab
are <tt>test-lab-3-b</tt> and <tt>test-lab-3-c</tt>, source in <tt>test-lab-3-b.c</tt>
and  <tt>test-lab-3-c.c</tt>.  The testers take two directories as
arguments, issue concurrent operations in the two directories, and check that
the results are consistent with the operations executing in some sequential order.
Here's a successful execution of the testers:

<pre>
% <b>./start.sh</b>
% <b>./test-lab-3-b ./yfs1 ./yfs2</b>
Create then read: OK
Unlink: OK
Append: OK
Readdir: OK
Many sequential creates: OK
Write 20000 bytes: OK
Concurrent creates: OK
Concurrent creates of the same file: OK
Concurrent create/delete: OK
Concurrent creates, same file, same server: OK
test-lab-3-b: Passed all tests.
% <b>./stop.sh</b>
%
% <b>./start.sh</b>
% <b>./test-lab-3-c ./yfs1 ./yfs2</b>
Create/delete in separate directories: tests completed OK
% <b>./stop.sh</b>
</pre>

<p>
If you try this before you add locking, it should fail at "Concurrent creates"
test in <tt>test-lab-3-b</tt>. If it fails before "Concurrent creates",
your code may have bugs despite having passed previous testers;
you should fix them before adding locks.

<p>After you are done with part 2, you should also test with 
<tt>test-lab-3-a.pl</tt> to make sure you didn't break
anything. You might also test <tt>test-lab-3-b</tt> with 
the same directory for both arguments, to make sure you handle concurrent
operations correctly with only one <tt>yfs_client</tt> before you go on to test concurrent 
operations with two <tt>yfs_client</tt>s.</p>

<!--

If you're unsure about what FUSE operations these two testers will
produce, check out the following FUSE trace logs:

<li> <a href="test4b-fuse2yfs2.log">Test 4b fuse2yfs2.log</a> (132 KB)

<li> <a href="test4c-fuse2yfs2.log">Test 4c fuse2yfs2.log</a> (120 KB)
-->

</ul>

<h3>Part 2: Detailed Guidance</h3>
<ul>
<li>What to lock?
<p>At one extreme you
could have a single lock for the whole file system, so that
operations never proceed in parallel. At the other extreme you
could lock each entry in a directory, or each field in the
attributes structure. Neither of these is a good idea! A single
global lock prevents concurrency that would have been okay, for
example CREATEs in different directories. Fine-grained locks have
high overhead and make deadlock likely, since you often need to
hold more than one fine-grained lock.</p>

<p>You should associate a lock with each inumber.  Use
the file or directory's <tt>inum</tt> as the name of the lock (i.e. pass the
<tt>inum</tt> to <tt>acquire</tt> and
<tt>release</tt>). The convention should be that any <tt>yfs_client</tt>
operation should acquire the lock on the file or directory it uses,
perform the operation, finish updating the extent server (if the
operation has side-effects), and then release the lock on the <tt>inum</tt>.
Be careful to release locks even for error returns
from <tt>yfs_client</tt> operations. 
<!---
You may find adding these acquire and
release calls a bit tedious.  It's okay to do things the tedious way,
but feel free to look for ways to make things a bit easier on you.
Hint: <tt>goto</tt> is not always considered harmful.</p>
-->

<p>You'll use your lock server from Lab 1.
<tt>yfs_client</tt> should create and use a
<tt>lock_client</tt> in the same
way that it creates and uses its <tt>extent_client</tt>.
</li>

<li>Things to watch out for:
<p>
This is the first lab that creates files using two different
YFS-mounted directories.  If you were not careful in earlier labs, you
may find that the components that assign <tt>inum</tt> for newly-created
files and directories choose the same identifiers.  One possible way
to fix this may be to seed the random number generator differently
depending on the process's <tt>pid</tt>. The provided code has already done
such seeding for you in the <tt>main</tt> function of <tt>fuse.cc</tt>.

<p>
This is also the first lab that writes null ('\0') characters to files.
The <tt>std::string(char*)</tt> constructor treats '\0' as
the end of the string, so if you use that constructor to hold
file content or the written data, you will have trouble with this lab.
<font color='red'>
Use the
<tt>std::string(buf, size)</tt> constructor instead.</font>.

</li>
</ul>

<h3>Handin procedure</h3>

E-mail your code as a gzipped tar file to <a
href="mailto:6.824-submit@pdos.csail.mit.edu">6.824-submit@pdos.csail.mit.edu</a>
by the deadline at the top of the page.  To do this, execute these
commands:

<pre>
% <b>cd ~/lab</b>
% <b>./stop.sh</b>
% <b>make clean</b>
% <b>rm core*</b>
% <b>rm *log</b>
% <b>cd ..</b>
% <b>tar czvf `whoami`-lab3.tgz lab/</b>
</pre>

or

<pre>
% <b>cd ~/6.824/lab</b>
% <b>make handin</b>
</pre>

That should produce a file called <nobr><tt>[your_user_name]-lab3.tgz</tt></nobr> in your
<tt>lab/</tt> directory.  Attach that file to an email and send it to the 6.824
submit address.
