<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>In this lab you will modify YFS to cache extents,
reducing the load on the extent server and improving YFS
performance. The main challenge is to ensure consistency of extents
cached at different <tt>yfs_client</tt>s: to make sure that
each <tt>yfs_client</tt> sees extent data that reflects the
latest modifications by other clients.
To achieve consistency we will use the
caching lock service from <a href="lab-4.html">Lab 4</a>.

<p>First you'll add a local <i>write-back</i> extent cache to each extent
client. The extent client will serve all extent operations from this
cache; the extent client will contact the extent server only to fetch an
extent (or the attribute of the extent) that is not present on the client. Then you'll make the caches
at different clients consistent by forcing write-back of the dirty
cached extent associated with a filehandle (and deletion of the clean
extent) when you release the lock on that filehandle.

<p>Your client will be a success if it manages to operate out of its
local extent and lock cache when reading/writing files and directories
that other hosts aren't looking at, but maintains correctness when the
same files and directories are concurrently read and updated by
multiple clients.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>Begin by initializing your Lab 5 branch with your implementation
from <a href="lab-4.html">Lab 4</a>.  There is no new code for this
lab, except for an update to the makefile to build this lab.</p>

<pre>
% <b>cd ~/lab</b>
% <b>git commit -am 'my solution to lab4'</b>

Created commit ...
% <b>git pull</b>
remote: Generating pack...
...
% <b>git checkout -b lab5 origin/lab5</b>
Branch lab5 set up to track remote branch refs/remotes/origin/lab5.
Switched to a new branch "lab5"
% <b>git merge lab4</b>
</pre>

<h3>Testing Performance</h3>

<p>
Our measure of performance is the number of <tt>put</tt>
and <tt>get</tt> RPCs that your
extent server receives. You can tell the extent server to print out a
line every 25 RPCs telling you the current totals as you did for the
lock server in Lab 4, by setting <tt>RPC_COUNT</tt> to 25.

<p>Then you can start the servers, run the <tt>test-lab-3-c</tt>
tester, and look in <tt>extent_server.log</tt> to see how many RPCs
have been received.

<pre>
% <b>export RPC_COUNT=25</b>
% <b>./start.sh</b>
% <b>./test-lab-3-c ./yfs1 ./yfs2</b>
Create/delete in separate directories: tests completed OK
% <b>grep "RPC STATS" extent_server.log</b>
...
RPC STATS: 1:2 6001:804 6002:2218 6003:1878 6004:198
% <b>./stop.sh</b>
</pre>

<p>
The <tt>RPC STATS</tt> line indicates the number of <tt>bind</tt>,
<tt>put</tt>,
<tt>get</tt>, <tt>getattr</tt>, and <tt>remove</tt>
RPCs received by the extent server.
The above line is the output of our solution for Lab 4. Your goal is
to reduce those numbers to about a dozen <tt>put</tt>s and at most a few
hundred <tt>get</tt>s.


<h3>Step One: Extent Cache</h3>

In Step One you'll add caching to your extent client, without cache
consistency. This cache will make your
<tt>yfs_client</tt> fast but inconsistent.

<p>Your new <tt>extent_client::get</tt>
should check if the extent is cached, and if so
return the cached copy. Otherwise <tt>get()</tt> should fetch the
extent from the extent server, put it in the local cache, and then
return it. <tt>put()</tt> should just replace the cached
copy, and not send it to the extent server. You'll find it helpful for
the next section if you keep track of which cached extents have been
modified by <tt>put()</tt> (<i>i.e.,</i> are
"dirty"). <tt>remove()</tt> should delete the extent from the local
cache.
<tt>extent_client</tt> should maintain cached attributes for each extent
so that <tt>extent_client::getattr()</tt> returns reasonable values.

<p>
When you're done, set <tt>RPC_COUNT</tt> and run <tt>test-lab-3-c</tt>
giving the same directory twice, and watch the RPC STATS printed by
the extent server. You should see zero <tt>put</tt>s and somewhere between zero
and a few hundred <tt>get</tt>s (or perhaps no numbers at all, if the value of
<tt>RPC_COUNT</tt> is more than the number of <tt>get</tt>s). Your server
should pass <tt>test-lab-3-a.pl</tt> and <tt>test-lab-3-b</tt> if you
give it the same directory twice, but it will probably fail
<tt>test-lab-3-b</tt> with two different directories because it has no
cache consistency.

<p>
You can modify <tt>extent_client.cc</tt>
and <tt>extent_client.h</tt>, or if you'd like, you can add the code
to a sub-class in a separate file. Remember to <tt>git add</tt> any
new files you create.

<h3>Step Two: Cache Consistency</h3>

<p>
In Step Two you'll ensure that each <tt>get()</tt> sees the latest
<tt>put()</tt>, even when the <tt>get()</tt> and <tt>put()</tt> are
from different YFS clients. The extent client and lock client will
cooperate to do this, helped by the <tt>yfs_client</tt> using the same
ID for a file/directory i-number, lock, and extent. When your lock
client releases a lock back to the lock server, you should ensure that
the extent client first flush the extent to the server, and then remove
it from local cache. A flush requires putting the corresponding extent (if
dirty) to the extent server, or removing the extent (if locally removed)
from the extent server.

<p>
Suppose client A acquires the lock on an i-number, get()s the file's
data from the extent server and modifies it in its extent client
cache, and keeps the lock and extent cached. Client B then asks for
the lock, so that the lock server sends client A a revoke message.
Client A will send the dirty data back to the extent server before
releasing the lock. Then B will acquire the lock and get() the
i-number's extent. Since B cannot have the extent in its cache (if it
ever cached it, it must have deleted it when it gave up the lock), and
A wrote the modified extent to the extent server before releasing the
lock, B will see A's modifications.

<p>
You will now be using locks for two different purposes: first, to
ensure that each file system operation is atomic; second, to drive the
extent cache consistency scheme. This may mean that you have to add
acquires and releases to <tt>yfs_client</tt> that were not necessary
to pass the tests for the previous labs. Ensure
that <b>every</b> <tt>yfs_client</tt> call to get(eid), put(eid),
getattr(eid), and remove(eid) is wrapped in acquire(eid)/release(eid).

<p>Add a method to the extent client to eliminate
an extent from the cache. This
<tt>flush()</tt> method should first check whether the extent is dirty
in the cache, in which case it should send it to the extent server.
If the extent has been removed (with the extent client's
<tt>remove()</tt> method), <tt>flush()</tt> should send a remove RPC
to the server.
<tt>extent_client</tt> should cache attributes fetched from the
server, and invalidate the relevant attributes in <tt>flush()</tt>.
You need not explicitly send dirty attributes to the extent server; instead,
it is enough to let the server update the attributes as a side-effect
of <tt>flush()</tt> sending a put RPC for a dirty extent.

<p>Your YFS server should call <tt>flush()</tt> just before
releasing a lock back to the lock server. You could just add
<tt>flush()</tt> calls to <tt>yfs_client.cc</tt> before each
<tt>release()</tt>. However, now that your lock client handles the
caching of locks, flushing an extent
in <tt>lock_client::release()</tt> is overkill; you only have to flush
an extent when the lock server revokes the corresponding lock.

<p>
We provide you with a bit of glue to connect the lock client to
the extent client in the form of the
<tt>lock_release_user</tt> class, defined in
<tt>lock_client_cache.h</tt>.  This is a virtual class supporting only
one method: <tt>dorelease(lock_protocol::lockid_t)</tt>.  Your job is to
subclass <tt>lock_release_user</tt> and implement that subclass's
<tt>dorelease</tt> method to call <tt>flush()</tt> on your extent
client for whatever data is about to lose its lock.  Then, create an
instance of this class and pass it into the <tt>lock_client_cache</tt>
object constructed in <tt>yfs_client.cc</tt>.  Finally, your
<tt>lock_client_cache</tt> must call the <tt>dorelease()</tt> method of
its <tt>lu</tt> object before it releases a lock back to the lock
server.  (Note that <tt>lu</tt> was defined and initialized in the
code we provided you for Lab 4.)
This will ensure that <tt>lock_client::flush()</tt>
is called before the lock is released.

<p>When you're done with Step Two your server should pass all the
correctness tests (<tt>test-lab-3-a.pl</tt>, <tt>test-lab-3-b</tt>,
and <tt>test-lab-3-c</tt> should execute correctly with two separate
YFS directories), and you should see a dramatic drop in the number of
<tt>put</tt>s and <tt>get</tt>s received by the extent server.

<h3>Hints</h3>

<ul>

<li>Make sure you use a pthreads mutex to protect the extent cache, in
case multiple threads access it at once.

<li>Make sure that, if you only read an extent (or its attributes),
you don't flush it back on a release.  You should keep a
flag in your cache that records if an extent (or its attributes) have
been modified.

<li>You may be able to implement the caching in the extent client
without modifying yfs_client.cc, except for instantiating (if you implemented
your caching extent client as a separate class) and passing 
the object that implements the <tt>lock_release_user</tt> interface in
<tt>yfs_client::yfs_client</tt>. However, as noted above, you
may have to add acquire and release calls to <tt>yfs_client</tt>.

</ul>

<h3>Collaboration policy</h3>You must write all the code you hand in
for the programming assignments, except for code that we give you as
part of the assignment. You are not allowed to look at anyone else's
solution (and you're not allowed to look at solutions from previous
years). You may discuss the assignments with other students, but you
may not look at or copy each others' code.

<h3>Handin procedure</h3>

E-mail your code as a gzipped tar file to <a
href="mailto:6.824-submit@pdos.csail.mit.edu">6.824-submit@pdos.csail.mit.edu</a>
by the deadline at the top of the page.  To do this, execute these
commands:

<pre>
% <b>cd ~/lab</b>
% <b>./stop.sh</b>
% <b>make clean</b>
% <b>rm core*</b>
% <b>rm *log</b>
% <b>cd ..</b>
% <b>tar czvf `whoami`-lab5.tgz lab/</b>
</pre>

or

<pre>
% <b>cd ~/6.824/lab</b>
% <b>make handin</b>
</pre>

That should produce a file called <tt>[your_user_name]-lab5.tgz</tt> in your
<tt>lab/</tt> directory.  Attach that file to an email and send it to the 6.824
submit address.
